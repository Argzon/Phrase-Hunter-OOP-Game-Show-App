# Phrase Hunter Game

In this project, we use different phrases which are selected randomly from `createPhrases()` function and it is selected randomly from `getRandomPhrase()`. Everytime you start a new game a random phrase is added to the display for you to guess it `addPhraseToDisplay()`.

You may click the buttons on screen which represents the keyboard or press the keys on your keyboard to interact with the game. The `handleInteraction()` checks for **correct** or **wrong** inputs.

You will loose a life for every wrong guess. So, be careful because when you loose all five lifes you will lose the game.
